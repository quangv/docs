What happens to my projects when I downgrade to Basic plan?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
All your projects stay the same. You can still work on them as usual. However, you cannot create a new project (in case your current projects are more than 3) because Basic plan can only have up to 3 active projects. In other words, an error message will be displayed when you try to create a new project.


What happens to my shared projects when I downgrade to Basic plan?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
 
If you are a member of a shared project, you cannot edit that project anymore when you are in Basic plan. However, you can still debug it through Monaca Debugger. 

On the other hand, if you are the owner of a shared project, you can still edit and work on that shared project normally but you cannot manage (add/remove) the members of that project anymore.
