What is the Monaca Debugger?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Monaca Debugger is an application for debugging that can check the functionality of the app on an actual device without building. 
When using Monaca Debugger, any changes made to the code immediately reflect to the actual running device. No build and run process are required.
This would help to speed up the development and testing process. For more details, please refer to  :doc:`../manual/debugger/index`. 


.. _faq06~002:

Are the operations of an app on the Monaca Debugger the same as when the app is installed on an actual device?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The app operations on Monaca Debugger may differ from the ones on the actual device. 
After building and installing the app, it is necessary to check its icon, installation and operations without Monaca Debugger. 
Moreover, the app works more slowly on Monaca Debugger than the built apps because of the connection to the Monaca Cloud IDE. 


.. _faq06~003:

The application using Monaca Debugger doesn't seem to be running properly. 
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Please try the following instructions:

* Make sure that you are having the latest version of Monaca Debugger.
* Reset the cache: in Monaca debugger menu select "Delete the sync data" and restart the app. 

If the issue still persists, please contact us via `Monaca Support <https://monaca.io/service/>`_.

.. _faq06~004:

Before building, can I check application operations during development?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Monaca provides utiliy to check the display and operations of application which is :ref:`Live Preview<preview_tab>` feature on the Monaca Cloud IDE. In addition, you can check application operations on the device prior to building by using Monaca Debugger. Both are very useful tools for improving development efficiency, so please make the most use of them.

.. _faq06~006:

Why are there two types (App Store version and Build version) of iOS version for Monaca Debugger?

JavaScript error when loading Angular.js or other external library.
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

In some cases, Monaca Debugger may assume the exceptions occurs internally by the external JavaScript library as errors. As long as the errors do not stop the functionality of your app, it should be fine to ignore them. Please note that in the built version, these errors should not be occurred when running on actual device.

.. _faq06~013:

What is the difference between Monaca Debugger and its custom build version?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Here are some important differences:

1. Where you download the debugger: Monaca Debugger can be downloaded from application markets. Custom build debugger can be installed from Monaca IDE.

2. Plugins included in the debugger: Monaca Debugger contains all core Cordova plugins. Custom build debugger will contain the plugins user submitted from Cordova Plugins configuration page.

3. USB debugging support (iOS Only): For iOS devices, USB debugging can be only enabled when the app is debug built. Therefore, you cannot do USB debugging on Monaca Debugger downloaded from App Store. For more details, please see :doc:`../manual/debugger/installation/debugger_ios`.

.. _faq06~014:

We are providing 3 different ways to debug your application.

1. Debug using preview panel
2. Debug using Monaca Debugger with Monaca IDE (Weinre)
3. Debug using Monaca Debugger with USB debugging

For more details, please refer to :doc:`../manual/debugger/debug`.
