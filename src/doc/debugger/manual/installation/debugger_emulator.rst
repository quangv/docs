======================================================================

.. rst-class:: right-menu


In this page, we will describe how Monaca Debugger works on AVD (Android Virtual Device) called Android Emulator. With this, you can simulate Android apps on a PC. Moreover, it is useful when you want to test your apps on more than one Android device. 

.. note:: In this page, the instruction is made on a Mac OS X. Internet is needed in order to run Monaca Debugger on emulator.

Step 1: Setting up an Android Virtual Device
================================================

1. Download and install `Android Studio <http://developer.android.com/sdk/index.html>`_.

2. Run Android Studio.

3. Create a new project or open an existing one.

4. Click on :guilabel:`AVD Manager`. Then, Android Virtual Device Manager dialog will appear.

Step 2: Building Custom Monaca Debugger for Android
==================================================================

1. Go Monaca Cloud IDE and build custom Monaca Debugger for Android. For more information, please refer to :ref:`custom_debugger_and`.
2. Download the debugger file and upload it to any file hosting services such as Google Drive, Dropbox and so on.
3. Get a download link of the uploaded file. You will need to use this link later in the virtual device.

Step 3: Installing Monaca Debugger
==========================================

1. Go to :guilabel:`AVD Manager` and launch the virtual device.
