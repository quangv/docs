Inside Debugger Menu, there are:

- *All Projects*: shows a list of all Monaca projects which can be run on Monaca Debugger. There are two types of projects in Monaca Debugger such as:

  1. Monaca.io projects: projects created in Monaca Cloud IDE.
  2. Local projects: projects created in :ref:`Monaca Localkit <monaca_localkit_index>` or :ref:`Monaca CLI <monaca_cli_index>` and stored in your local PC. Local projects appear only when the debugger is paired with Monaca Localkit/CLI.

- *Local Computers*: shows a list of all currently paired and available computers. Paired computers are local computers running Monaca Localkit/CLI and currently connected to the debugger. You may want to refer to the following pages:

  1. :ref:`Pairing Monaca Debugger with Monaca Localkit <localkit_pairing_debugging>`
  2. :ref:`Pairing Monaca Debugger with Monaca CLI <connect_to_debugger>`

Inside this Project Options button, you can:

- favorite current project: moves it to the top of the project list.

- lunch app: runs current project in the debugger.

- network install: installs a built app of the current project directly from Monaca debugger. 

.. note:: In order to use network install, you need to create a debug build of the project from Monaca Cloud IDE first. Please refer to :ref:`debug build for iOS <types_of_build_ios>` or :ref:`debug build for Android <types_of_build_android>`.

.. note:: For iOS debugger, network install is only available for the :ref:`custom built debugger <custom_debugger_ios>`. The App store version doesn't have this function.
