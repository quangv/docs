  <!doctype html> 
  <html> 
    <head> 
      <meta charset="UTF-8" />
      <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, user-scalable=no">
      <script type="text/javascript" src="components/loader.js"></script>
    </head> 
    <body> 
      <audio src="http://audio.ibeat.org/content/p1rj1s/p1rj1s_-_rockGuitar.mp3" controls></audio>
