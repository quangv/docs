Everytime you build your app through Monaca IDE, Monaca saves your build history where you can see your build detail and error logs.


View build history
==========================================

You can view your build history as following:

1. From the Monaca Cloud IDE menu, go to :menuselection:`Build --> Build History`.


2. Your built history will be displayed as following.

    .. figure:: images/history/1.png
      :width: 600px
      :align: left

  .. rst-class:: clear

3. Click on :guilabel:`Remove` button to remove particular item from your history or :guilabel:`Download` button to download the built app. Once you click on :guilabel:`Remove` button, it cannot be undone.
