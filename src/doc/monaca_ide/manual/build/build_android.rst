Types of Build
=============================

In Monaca, Android app has two types of build: debug version and release version. The differences between these types of build are as follows:


+------------------+----------------------------------------+----------------------------------------------------+
| Types of Build   | Description                            |  Installation                                      |
+==================+========================================+====================================================+
| *Debug Build*    | An unsigned package which cannot       | - QR Code                                          |

|                  |                                        | - Sideloading                                      |
+------------------+----------------------------------------+----------------------------------------------------+
| *Release Build*  | a signed package with the developer's  | - Sideloading                                      |

|                  | the market.                            |                                                    |
+------------------+----------------------------------------+----------------------------------------------------+


.. note:: Sideloading means installing an application package in APK format onto an Android device. After building your app, you can download the APK file and install it.

.. _config_android_app:  

Step 1: Configure Android App
=================================

1. From the Monaca Cloud IDE menu, go to :menuselection:`Config --> Android App Settings`.

2. Fill in the necessary information of your app:

  - General settings:

      .. rst-class:: wide-table

        +-------------------------+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
        | Application Name        | a name representing your app publicly such as in the Market.                                    |
        +-------------------------+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
        | Package Name            | a unique name which will be used when uploading to the Android Market. It is recommended to use |
        |                         | reverse-domain style (for example, mobi.monaca.appname) for App ID. Only alphanumeric characters|
        |                         | and periods (at least one period must be used) are allowed. Each segment separated by a period  |
        |                         | should begin with an alphabetic character.                                                      |
        +-------------------------+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
        | Use Different Package   | if enable, the package name of the release-built and debug-built apps are different. In other   |
        | Name for Debug Build    | words, the package name of debug-built app will have ``.debug`` extension, and the one for      |
        |                         | project debugger will have ``.debugger`` extension. However, this option is disable by default  |
        |                         | because it made some plugins impossible to be debugged due to the fact that they are tied to    |
        |                         | exact package names (eg. in-app purchase).                                                      |
        +-------------------------+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
        | Version                 | the version number of your app. A version number consist of only number seperated by dots       |
        |                         | (for example, 1.0.0).                                                                           |
        +-------------------------+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
        | Version Code            | an internal version number of your app, relative to other versions. The value must be integer,  |
        |                         | so that the applications can programmatically evaluate it for an upgrade.                       |
        +-------------------------+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
        | Fullscreen              | this option is only available with the Cordova 3.5 and later. If enable, your app will be run   |
        |                         | in a fullscreen mode which hide the status bar.                                                 |
        +-------------------------+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+

      .. rst-class:: wide-table

        +---------------------+----------------+-----------------------------------------------------------------------+

        +---------------------+----------------+-----------------------------------------------------------------------+

3. After finishing the configurations, click :guilabel:`Save`.


.. _config_android_keystore:  

Step 2: Configure Android Keystore
======================================

A keystore is a binary file that contains a set of private keys. A private key represents the entity to be identified with the app, such as a person or a company. A keystore is encrypted with a password and it cannot be restored if the password is lost. When a keystore is lost or it overwrites another keystore, it is impossible to use the same key to re-sign the signed package.

A keystore is required for the building of a release version for your Android app. In Monaca, you can either create a new keystore or import an existing one. In order to create a new keystore, please do as follows:

1. From the Monaca Cloud IDE menu, go to :menuselection:`Config --> Android KeyStore Settings`.

2. Then, Manage KeyStore and Alias page will appear.

3. Click on :guilabel:`Clear and Generate New...` button. Then, the following screen will appear:

  .. figure:: images/android/3.png
    :width: 400px
    :align: left

  .. rst-class:: clear

4. Fill in the necessary information as shown in the above screen such as 
    
  - Alias: a name representing a private key that you will use later when signing your app. Multiple aliases can be stored within one keystore.
  - Password: a password for the private key (alias).
  - Password of the keystore: a password for the keystore. You will need this password when importing this keystore. 

5. Then, click :guilabel:`Generate Keystore and Alias` button to Generate the keystore.

.. note:: When a keystore is lost, it is impossible to use the same key to re-sign the signed package. Therefore, always back up and keep the keystore which is used to sign application(s). Use the :guilabel:`Export` button to download your keystore.
