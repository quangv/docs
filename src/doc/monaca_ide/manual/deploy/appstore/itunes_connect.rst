  .. rst-class:: wide-table

    +-------------------------+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
    | Platforms               | Choose a platform for your app.                                                                  |
    +-------------------------+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
    | Name                    | Enter your app's name as it will appear on the App Store. It can't be longer than 255 characters.|
    +-------------------------+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
    | Primary Language        | Choose a default language for your app.                                                          |
    +-------------------------+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
    | Bundle ID               | Select a Bundle ID which can be an explicit App ID or a wildcard App ID. If itâ€™s a wildcard App  |
    |                         | ID, you also need to specify a bundle ID suffix. If it's an explicit App ID, it must exactly     |
    |                         | match the bundle identifier in your app.                                                         |          
    +-------------------------+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
    | Bundle ID Suffix        | Once you select a Bundle ID, the input field for Bundle ID Suffix will be displayed. It's a      |
    |                         | string that is appended to the bundle ID property if the bundle ID is a wildcard App ID. The     |
    |                         | bundle ID and bundle ID suffix must form a bundle identifier that exactly matches the bundle     |
    |                         | identifier in your app.                                                                          |
    +-------------------------+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
    | SKU                     | Enter the code to identify the app. Although the code is up to your decision, it is necessary to |
    |                         | create an ID that will identify the app in a unique way.                                         |

.. _upload_the_app:

Uploading the App
===================================================

In the past, it was not necessary to have a Mac environment for submission. However, since August 2012, a Mac environment has become necessary as the Application Loader is needed to upload the apps to iTunes Connect and it is only compatible with Mac. 

Fortunately, Monaca allows you to upload your app to iTunes Connect right from Monaca IDE. In other words, you don't need a Mac to upload your apps anymore. 

.. note:: For more information on how to use this upload feature, please refer to :ref:`upload_via_ide`.

Alternatively, you can use the Application Loader as described below:

1. Create and download a release build version of your app through Monaca. Please refer to :ref:`building_for_ios`.

2. From iTunes Connect, download and install Application Uploader.

  .. rst-class:: clear

3. Open Application Uploader and login with your Apple account.

4. Select :guilabel:`Deliver Your App` and click :guilabel:`Choose`.

  .. rst-class:: clear

6. Once, the uploading is completed, click :guilabel:`Next` and :guilabel:`Done`. It may take sometimes until the app shows up in the iTunes Connect.

  .. note:: If you upload multiple versions of the app, please make sure that each app file has different version number. Otherwise, the upload will fail.

.. _select_uploaded_app:

Selecting the Uploaded App

Once you successfully uploaded your app to iTunes Connect, it can be selected to submit to the App Store. Please do as follows:

1. From iTunes Connect, go to :guilabel:`Prepare for Submission`. Under Build section, click :guilabel:`+`.

  .. rst-class:: clear

3. Click :guilabel:`Save`.


Submitting the App
===================================================

Now that you have completed the necessary configurations, your app is ready to be submitted. 

1. From iTune Connect, go to :guilabel:`Prepare for Submission`.

2. Click :guilabel:`Submit for Review`.


After you've successfully submitted the app, you will need to wait for the review from Apple. Apple will review your app and see if it is eligible or qualified to be in App Store. Usually, it takes two weeks for the review. Therefore, please wait patiently for it.


.. _app_release:

Publishing the App
===================================================

When your app is accepted by Apple, it will be up in the App Store.

.. note:: The large app icon, which was not necessary before, is now required for the submission. In fact, the required environment and information have changed in the submission procedure for the registration. If a registration/submission is not successful, please make sure you complete necessary configurations properly.
