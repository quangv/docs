Right-click on a folder or file to see additional functions such as New File, Copy, Rename, Delete, Upload File and so on. To edit a file, select it and then its content will be shown in :ref:`Monaca IDE Editor<code_editor>`.

.. _debug_panel:

Debug Panel
===================

Once Monaca Debugger is connected with Monaca Cloud IDE, you can do console debugging as well DOM inspection in this panel. For more information, please refer to :ref:`by_debugger_ide`.

.. _preview_team_panel:

.. _preview_tab:

Live Preview
==================================

The Live Preview provides an overview of your app in real-time. You can also interact with this preview as if it is running on an actual device with the limitation of executing the specific device’s functionality (such as camera, contact and so on) and cross-origin network AJAX request. Along with the Monaca Debugger, you will have effective and efficient experiences during app development. 


In this tab, you can:

- refresh the Preview window.

- change the display device's screen by clicking on the :guilabel:`Configure` icon in that tab. Then, you will see a drop-down list of different devices such as iPad, iPhone, and Nexus. You can change the orientation of the screen as well.

- detach/attach the Preview window.

.. rst-class:: clear

*Live Preivew Limitations*

When using Live Preview, you should be aware of the the following limitations:

- Cordova Plugin APIs are not available.
- Ajax requests will fail because of Cross-origin restriction. However, it can be done if server-side scripts return "Access-Control-Allow-Origin” Header (i.e., Cross-Origin Ajax Request is permitted).
- Viewport appearance may differ from real devices.
- Monaca Backend API and Push Notifications can not be initialized.

.. _team_tab:

Share
==================================

.. note:: The usability of this function depends on your Monaca subscription plan. For more information, please refer to `Monaca Subscription Plan <https://monaca.mobi/en/pricing>`_.



The *Share* function allows you to:

- manage the team: add/remove members to the shared project.

- share the source code with multiple people (members are assigned as Developers). There are 3 ways to do this such as:

  1. The easiest way is to use Monaca Cloud's Team Management function. Then, two or more people can open the same project in different Monaca Cloud IDEs. However, if there is any conflict while updating the project, the previous version of the project will be overwritten (but it still remains in the file history). 

  2. Another way is to set up a version control system and do the local development using :ref:`Monaca Localkit <monaca_localkit_index>` or :ref:`Monaca CLI <monaca_cli_index>`. This requires a higher skill set, but more collaborative.

  3. The last option is to use :ref:`Monaca for Visual Studio <monaca_vs_index>`. In this case, files can be managed by Visual Studio's built-in Team Explorer function. Git, TFS, Visual Studio Online and other supported version control system can be used in this case.

- let multiple people to test the project (members are assigned as Testers). 


.. note:: If your Monaca subscription plan is Basic or Personal, you can only chat and join a team as a Tester.


You can share your project with other Monaca users. You can also add/remove other Monaca users to/from your project. In order to manage the members of your project, please do as follows:

1. Click on :guilabel:`Share` button in the Menu panel.

2. Then, the Team Member Manage screen will appear. To add a member, input the email(s) of your team member(s). Please enter one email address per line. You can also assign the role of each member as Developer or Tester by choosing from the drop-down menu. Then, click :guilabel:`Add Member` button to send the invitation to them.
