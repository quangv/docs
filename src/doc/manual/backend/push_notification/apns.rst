Overview
================================================

APNs (Apple Push Notification Service) is a push notification mechanism created by Apple to use with iOS apps. 

In this page, we will show what you need to do in order to enable push notifications service for iOS applications with Monaca. 

There are two types of Push certificates:

- Development Push Certificate: required for Debug build.
- Production Push Certificate: required for either Ad Hoc or Release build.

Please refer to :ref:`types_of_build_ios`.

.. note:: In order to build iOS applications and send push notifications to them, it is necessary to join the `iOS Developer Program <https://developer.apple.com/programs/ios/>`_. 


Step 1: Create a Request File in Monaca Cloud IDE
===========================================================
