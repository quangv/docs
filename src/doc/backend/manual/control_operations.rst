.. _backend_control_panel_collection_management:

Collection Management
==========================================================


A Collection refers to a group of data. You can manage the appropriate data used within an application based on permissions you granted to each user. User permissions you can grant to each user are *create*, *access*, *edit*, *delete* or *read-only*.

In this section, an example of how to manage a Collection is illustrated. In this example, *_id*, *name*, *color* and *taste* are used as fields of the properties. Each row of data (such as: lemon, yellow, sour) is called *collection item*. A unit comprising of all of these items is called a *Collection*. To put it as database terminology, a Collection is a table, and Collection Items are records.

Collection item has several system properties that start with an underscore (``_``). For example, ``_id`` is, one of system properties, unique ID of an item.

+------------+----------+----------+--------------+
| _id        | name     | color    | taste        |
+============+==========+==========+==============+
| 00001abc   | apple    | red      | sweet        |
+------------+----------+----------+--------------+
| 00002def   | orange   | orange   | sour-sweet   |
+------------+----------+----------+--------------+
| 00003ghi   | lemon    | yellow   | sour         |
