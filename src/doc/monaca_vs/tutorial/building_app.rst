.. _monaca_vs_building_app:==================================Part 3: Building Monaca App==================================.. rst-class:: right-menuIn this tutorial, we only cover how to build Monaca Apps for iOS and Android:1. :ref:`monaca_vs_building_for_ios`2. :ref:`monaca_vs_building_for_android`For more information on how to build Monaca apps for other platforms, please refer to :ref:`build_index`... _monaca_vs_building_for_ios:Building a Monaca App for iOS==================================This section will cover an instruction of how to create a debug build version of your app for iOS which will be installed on the development device. For more information about other types of build, please refer to :ref:`types_of_build_ios`.*Prerequisite*:  You must enroll in `iOS Developer Program <https://developer.apple.com/programs/ios/>`_. *Requirement*You are required to create the following items from iOS Provisioning Portal after enrolling iOS Developer Program:- ``App ID`` (see :ref:`register_appID` and :ref:`register_dev_device`)- ``Developer Certificate`` (see :ref:`create_cer`)- ``Development Provisioning Profile`` (see :ref:`register_provisioning`)Step 1: Configuring iOS App Settings^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^1. From Monaca panel, select :menuselection:`Build Settings --> iOS App`.2. Fill in the necessary information of your app:  - Application Name: a public name representing your app.  - App ID: a unique ID representing your app. It is recommended to use reverse-domain style (for example, mobi.monaca.appname) for App ID. Only alphanumeric characters and periods (at least one period must be used) are allowed. Each segment separated by a period should begin with an alphabetic character.  - Version Number: a number representing the version of your app which will be required when uploading (publishing process) your application via iTune Connect later. It needs 3 numbers separated by dots (for example, 1.10.2). Each number should be in [0-99].  - The remaining information is optional. You can configure icon, splash screen and other configurations in this page.  .. figure:: images/building_app/ios_1.png    :width: 600px    :align: left  .. rst-class:: clear  .. warning:: The App ID in Monaca Build Settings must be the same as the App ID you have registered in iOS Provisioning Portal. This App ID (in Monaca Build Settings) cannot contain asterisk (``*``); otherwise, the build will fail.3. After finishing the configurations, click :guilabel:`Save`.   Step 2: Configuring iOS Build Settings^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^1. From Monaca panel, select :menuselection:`Build Settings --> iOS Build`.2. Click on :guilabel:`Generate Key and CSR` button and fill in your Apple ID information (user name and email address). Then, click :guilabel:`Generate Key and CSR` button. You can also import an existing private key if you have one.  .. figure:: images/building_app/ios_2.png    :width: 400px    :align: left  .. rst-class:: clear3. Export the Certificate Signing Request (CSR) file. It will be required to issue the certificates later in iOS Provisioning Portal.  .. figure:: images/building_app/ios_4.png    :width: 500px    :align: left  .. rst-class:: clear.. note:: If you import an existing private key, you need to use the certificates which are issued based on that imported private key. However, if you create a new private key, you will need to use the new CRS file to issue new certificates. Step 3: Building the App^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^1. From Monaca panel, select :guilabel:`Build`.2. Select ``iOS`` platform.3. Select :guilabel:`Debug Build` and click :guilabel:`Next` button.  .. figure:: images/building_app/ios_5.png    :width: 500px    :align: left  .. rst-class:: clear4. Upload the development provisioning profile and click :guilabel:`Next` button.5. It may take several minutes for the build process to complete. Please wait. The following screen will appear after the build is completed.  .. figure:: images/building_app/ios_6.png    :width: 500px    :align: left  .. rst-class:: clearStep 4: Installing the App^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^1. Download the debug build version file of your app.2. Use iTunes to install it on your iOS device... _monaca_vs_building_for_android:Building a Monaca App for Android=======================================This section will cover an instruction of how to create a debug build version of your app for Android. For more information about other types of build, please refer to :ref:`types_of_build_android`.Step 1: Configuring Android App Settings^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^1. From Monaca panel, select :menuselection:`Build Settings --> Android App`.2. Fill in the necessary information of your app:  - Application Name: a public name representing your app.  - Package Name: a unique ID representing your app. It is recommended to use reverse-domain style (for example, mobi.monaca.appname) for App ID. Only alphanumeric characters and periods (at least one period must be used) are allowed. Each segment separated by a period should begin with an alphabetic character.  - Version Number: a number representing the version of your app. It needs 3 numbers separated by dots (for example, 1.10.2). Each number should be in [0-99].  - Use Different Package Name for Debug Build: if checked, the package name of the debug-built app and custom-built debugger are different. In other words, the package name of debug-built app will have ``.debug`` extension, and the one for custom-built debugger will have ``.debugger`` extension. However, this option is disable by default because it made some plugins impossible to be debugged due to the fact that they are tied to exact package names (for example, in-app purchase).  - The remaining information is optional. You can configure icon, splash screen and other configurations in this page.  .. figure:: images/building_app/android_1.png    :width: 600px    :align: left  .. rst-class:: clear3. After finishing the configurations, click :guilabel:`Save`.Step 2: Configuring Android KeyStore ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^Android keystore is used to store keys (alias) needed to sign a package. When a keystore is lost or it is overwritten by another keystore, it is impossible to re-sign the signed package with the same key. One keystore can contain multiple aliases, but only one alias is used for code signing an application.In order to configure Android keystore in Monaca, please do as follows:1. From Monaca panel, select :menuselection:`Build Settings --> Android Build`.2. You will need to generate a new keystore if you haven't created one yet. You can also import an existing keystore. In this tutorial, we assume that you need to create a new keystore. Therefore, click on :guilabel:`Clear and Generate New...` button.  .. figure:: images/building_app/android_2.png    :width: 600px    :align: left  .. rst-class:: clear  3. Fill in the necessary information related to the keystore such as:  - Alias: key information stored in the keystore which is used to sign an app package.  - Password: password for the alias.  - KeyStore Password: password for the new keystore.  .. figure:: images/building_app/android_3.png    :width: 400px    :align: left  .. rst-class:: clear     4.
