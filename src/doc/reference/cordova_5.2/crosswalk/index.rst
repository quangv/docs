.. note:: 
    
    This document is based on the original Cordova docs available at `Cordova Docs <https://github.com/crosswalk-project/cordova-plugin-crosswalk-webview>`_.


This plugin makes your Cordova application uses the `Crosswalk WebView <https://crosswalk-project.org/>`__ instead of the System WebView. 

What is Crosswalk?
================================================

There are many versions of Android from many manufacturers, this makes it very difficult to develop a Cordova app that works consistently across all versions of Android. WebView version affects display and some operations on a device. Until Android 4.4, WebView upgrade can only be done through OS upgrade. When most of these devices cannot be upgraded, they are stuck using outdated Android WebViews. Crosswalk can solve this problem.

Crosswalk is a web runtime based on Google Chromium and has better HTML5 feature support compared to the default WebView available in Android. By upgrading the version of Crosswalk, Chromium version will also be upgraded. This insures that your app works consistently, regardless of the device manufacturer or Android version found in your customer's Android 4.0+ device.
